# Bootstrap script for kurowski/dotfiles.
#
# Run this on a fresh Linux or macOS machine:
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kurowski/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh | bash
#
# Flow:
#   1. Download the hm binary for this os/arch.
#   2. `hm bootstrap` ensures prerequisites: git + ca-certificates on
#      Linux, just git (via the Xcode CLT) on macOS, so HTTPS clones
#      work and the next step plus all future `hm apply` runs can
#      reach GitHub.
#   3. Clone this repo and exec `hm apply`.
#
# This file is generated and stays Homie's — it tracks how the current hm
# wants to be launched, so it goes stale when you upgrade. Refresh it with
# `hm init --update` from this repo, then commit the diff. Local edits are
# safe: update shows what it would change and stops rather than clobbering
# (`--force` to override). Delete the hm:generated line below to opt out
# and own this file yourself.

# Under `curl ... | bash` stdin is the pipe this script is being read from,

# bootstrap`, `sudo` inside a setup script during apply, a credential helper
# during the clone — then dies with "a terminal is required to read the
# password" and takes the run down with it. So hand those children the
# controlling terminal when there is one; in CI and containers there's no
# /dev/tty (and sudo is passwordless anyway), so they keep the stdin they had.
